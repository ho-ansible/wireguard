# Ansible role: WireGuard
Point-to-point VPN.

This role uses the built-in wireguard support in systemd-networkd as of v237.

Keys are stored as hostvars in YAML files in the inventory, and also cached as host facts.

## Requirements
Debian bullseye.

OpenVZ support is a to-do item.

## Role Variables
+ `wg_name` (default: `wg0`): name for the interface
+ `wg_ip` (default: `192.168.1.1/24`): IPv4 address and subnet of this host within the VPN
+ `wg_peers` (default: none): inventory host list, passed to `inventory_hostnames` query
+ `wg_port` (default: 51820): UDP port to use for VPN traffic
+ `wg_ext_ip` (default: `ansible_default_ipv4.address`): 
  public IP address (without subnet).
  Peers will connect to this IP and 
  create a firewall rule allowing packets from this IP.
+ `wg_allowedips` (default: none): list of subnet destinations allowed 
  to be sent via this peer.

All the above vars are read from other hosts via `hostvars[]`, so
they should be set in inventory -- don't rely on the role defaults.

Optional role vars for `[Wireguard]` section of netdev:
+ `wg_fwmark`: firewall mark to set on outgoing packets

Optional role vars for `[WireguardPeer]` section of netdev:
+ `wg_psk`: preshared key generated by `wg genpsk`
+ `wg_keepalive`: interval in seconds to send keepalive packets.
  If this variable is set, the option will be enabled for all peers from this host.

Optional role vars for systemd network file:
+ `wg_dns`: list of DNS servers
+ `wg_domains`: list of domains using above DNS servers, optionally prefixed with `~`.
  See systemd.network(5).
+ `wg_network_opts`: additional text for the systemd network file, in ini format
  with newlines

Optional role vars for systemd-networkd service:
+ `wg_extra_iptables`: list of additional firewall rules, as strings starting with the chain name.

## Playbooks
+ `main.yml`: installs/configures wireguard
+ `uninstall.yml`: uninstalls wireguard. Run prior to removing host from inventory group.
